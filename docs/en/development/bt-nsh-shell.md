# BT-side NSH shell (`MODE SHELL`)

The `btsensor` daemon can expose an **NSH console over the existing
SPP RFCOMM channel** (Issue #108).  Useful when the Hub is running
on battery (e.g. a roving robot) and you need to query state or send
commands without re-tethering USB.  The USB-side NSH on `/dev/console`
is unaffected.

## Architecture

```
PC ── BT/SPP/RFCOMM ── btsensor (userspace)
                          │
                          ├─ MODE_TELEMETRY (default) — RFCOMM RX → btsensor_cmd_feed
                          │     IMU/sensor BUNDLE frames at 100 Hz
                          │
                          ├─ MODE_SHELL_STARTING (transient) — OK\n in flight; stdin send forbidden
                          │
                          └─ MODE_SHELL — RFCOMM ↔ /dev/btnsh_in/out FIFO ↔ NSH child task
                                           btnsh_main calls nsh_session() directly
```

Telemetry and shell are **mutually exclusive**.  Entering shell mode
auto-disables the IMU/SENSOR pumps; they stay off after exiting (you
must re-issue `IMU ON` / `SENSOR ON` explicitly).

## Protocol

### Entering shell mode

Over the existing SPP/RFCOMM connection:

```
PC -> Hub:  MODE SHELL\n
Hub -> PC:  OK\n               <- MODE_SHELL_STARTING up to here (do NOT send stdin yet)
PC -> Hub:  ls /dev\n          <- After OK, bytes go to NSH stdin
Hub -> PC:  /dev/btnsh_in\n
            /dev/btnsh_out\n
            /dev/console\n
            ...
            nsh>\n
```

Anything sent before `OK\n` arrives is defensively dropped on the Hub
side (logged as `syslog` warning).  **Peer contract: no stdin until
`OK\n` is observed.**

### Leaving shell mode

Type `exit` inside NSH or drop the RFCOMM link from the PC:

```
PC -> Hub:  exit\n
Hub -> PC:  ... NSH output ...
            <- child task exits, stdout EOF, internal teardown runs
Hub -> PC:  READY\n            <- telemetry mode resumed; commands accepted again
PC -> Hub:  IMU ON\n           <- explicit re-enable (not auto-resumed)
Hub -> PC:  OK\n
```

`READY\n` indicates the daemon is back in telemetry mode and ready
for ASCII commands.

If the PC drops RFCOMM, the Hub does `kill(SIGKILL)` + reap + cleanup
internally and falls back to MODE_TELEMETRY.  `READY\n` is **not**
sent in that case (no peer to receive it).

### `MODE SHELL` failures

If `shell_enter` fails (`pipe()` / `open()` / `posix_spawn`) or the
TX response queue cannot accept `OK\n`:

```
Hub -> PC:  ERR shell_<step> <errno>\n
```

Or:

```
Hub -> PC:  ERR shell_no_buffer\n
Hub -> PC:  ERR shell_unavailable\n   <- mkfifo failed at daemon start
```

**Note**: by the time `MODE SHELL` is parsed, IMU/SENSOR pumps are
already disabled.  `ERR` does **not** restore them; re-issue
`IMU ON\n` / `SENSOR ON\n` if needed.

## USB-NSH side

The `btsensor mode` builtin can switch from the USB side too:

```
nsh> btsensor mode shell
OK
nsh> # USB NSH is still usable; the spawned BT shell waits for a peer
nsh> btsensor mode telemetry
OK
```

`btsensor mode telemetry` from USB is a force-teardown escape hatch —
useful if the BT peer wedged the shell.

## Known limitations

- **No Ctrl-C / job control**: the FIFO is not a tty and the child
  is spawned with `isctty=false`, so `TIOCSCTTY` is not issued.
  Long-running commands can only be aborted by dropping RFCOMM.
- **No CRLF / ANSI normalisation**: configure local echo and CRLF
  translation on the peer's terminal emulator (`screen`/`picocom`
  with their respective flags).
- **stdin overflow**: pasting more than the FIFO buffer (4096 B by
  default) drops the overflow.  Interactive typing is unaffected.
  Drops are logged in the Hub `syslog`; the peer is not notified.
- **No concurrent SPP clients**: same as the rest of `btsensor` —
  one RFCOMM channel only.
- **stdout overflow**: very chatty NSH output (`dmesg`, etc.) past
  the TX coalescing buffer (1024 B default) is dropped by the
  reader thread with a syslog warning.
- **No simultaneous telemetry frames**: shell and BUNDLE telemetry
  are exclusive; switch back via `MODE TELEMETRY` (or `exit`) to
  resume telemetry.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| No reply to `MODE SHELL` | IMU/SENSOR pump still on | Send `IMU OFF\n` / `SENSOR OFF\n` first |
| `ERR shell_unavailable` | `mkfifo` failed at daemon init (CONFIG_PIPES / CONFIG_DEV_FIFO_SIZE missing) | Check defconfig; `btsensor stop` → `start` |
| `OK\n` arrives but no NSH output | Child task spawn / stack starvation | `nsh> ps` to inspect `btnsh` task; raise `CONFIG_APP_BTSENSOR_SHELL_NSH_STACK` |
| Large output truncated | TX coalescing buffer overflowed | Raise `CONFIG_APP_BTSENSOR_SHELL_TX_BUF` (2048/4096) |
| No `READY\n` on exit | Exit happened via RFCOMM drop | Expected; reconnect and confirm telemetry by `IMU ON` |
